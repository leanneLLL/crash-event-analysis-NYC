# Motor Vehicles Collisions Analysis in NYC

## About The Project
This is a dashboard dashboard web application built using Python and Streamlit that analyze the dataset [Motor Vehicle Collisions - Crashes](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95)  in New York City from [NYC OpenData](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/).

To make more direct interactions with everything, I used pandas and NumPy in Python to analyze the data and built interactable visualizations based on a user-selected threshold using pydeck and plotly.
