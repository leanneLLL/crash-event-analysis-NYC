# Motor Vehicles Collisions Analysis in NYC
This is a Streamlit dashboard application for analyzing motor vehicle collisions in NYC
## About The Project
This is a dashboard web app built using Python and Streamlit that analyze the [Motor Vehicle Collisions - Crashes](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95)  in NYC dataset from [NYC OpenData](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/)

To make more direct interactions with everything, I used pandas and NumPy in Python to analyze the data and built interactable visualizations based on a user-selected threshold using pydeck and plotly

## Built With
The game was developed mainly using Python and Streamlit.
